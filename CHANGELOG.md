# Code Editor Package for Antigravity — Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-23

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE — package renamed

The package's UPM `name` field has changed from `com.unity.ide.antigravity` to **`com.badranraza.ide.antigravity`**.

Why: the `com.unity.*` namespace is reserved by Unity Technologies, and OpenUPM rejects packages that use it. Renaming unblocks the OpenUPM listing (https://github.com/openupm/openupm/pull/6490 was closed for exactly this reason) and defends against any future Unity namespace enforcement. No Unity Technologies code is involved in this rename — only the UPM identifier.

**Migrating from v1.x:**

1. In Unity Package Manager, remove the old `com.unity.ide.antigravity` entry.
2. Re-add via the same git URL: `https://github.com/BadranRaza/com.unity.ide.antigravity.git`. Package Manager will install it under the new `com.badranraza.ide.antigravity` name.
3. Your External Tools selection in `Edit > Preferences > External Tools` survives the rename. No code changes are required in your Unity projects.

The GitHub repo URL is unchanged — only the UPM package identifier inside `package.json` changed.

### Changed

- `package.json` `name`: `com.unity.ide.antigravity` → `com.badranraza.ide.antigravity`.
- `CITATION.cff` `version`: 1.0.7 → 2.0.0.
- All Antigravity IDE detection, FAQ, deep-dive doc, issue templates and trust files shipped in v1.0.6–v1.0.8 are carried forward unchanged.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Troubleshooting / FAQ section in README** answering the most common questions about the Antigravity 2.0 split: Unity opening the wrong app, the IDE not appearing in the dropdown, IntelliSense, reuse-window not working, and Insider build detection.
- **Comparison table** in README listing the other community Antigravity Unity packages, their last push and Antigravity-2.0-fix status as of May 2026.
- **Deep-dive doc** (`Documentation~/antigravity-2-0-fix.md`) explaining the I/O 2026 product split, why script opens started routing to the agent app, and the three-layer fix in this package (filename filter, manifest verification, narrowed search paths).
- **GitHub issue forms**: bug report, feature request, plus a contact-links config that points open-ended questions at Discussions and Antigravity-IDE bugs at Google's forum.
- **`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`** with a platform-tested checklist.
- **`SECURITY.md`** with private vulnerability reporting instructions and an explicit in/out-of-scope list.
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** adopting Contributor Covenant 3.0 (the version Django moved to in April 2026).
- **`CITATION.cff`** so the repo gets the "Cite this repository" widget.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-05-23

### Changed

- **License reverted to plain MIT.** The PolyForm Noncommercial dual-license briefly introduced in v1.0.6 has been rolled back. The entire package — including v1.0.7 and all earlier versions — is now uniformly governed by the MIT License again. No commercial-license step is required; use freely in personal, commercial and Asset Store projects.
- README polished for discoverability: added release / Unity version / license / stars / forks badges, "Support the project" section (star / share / issues / PRs), and a star-the-repo prompt.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- Unity no longer routes C# script opens to the standalone **Antigravity 2.0 agent app**. Google's I/O 2026 release split the product line into the agent-first "Antigravity" desktop app and the VS Code-fork "Antigravity IDE"; previously the package discovered both, so users with both installed could end up launching the agent app (which has no editor surface) on every script open.
  - `IsCandidateForDiscovery` now requires `Antigravity IDE*.exe` / `Antigravity IDE*.app` / `antigravity-ide[-insiders]` filenames.
  - `TryDiscoverInstallation` reads `resources/app/package.json` and rejects any install whose product name is not `Antigravity IDE` (defence-in-depth if a user points External Tools at the agent app manually).
  - `GetVisualStudioInstallations` only lists IDE candidates; the plain `Antigravity.exe` / `antigravity` / `antigravity.desktop` paths were removed on Windows, macOS and Linux.
  - Reuse-existing-window process matching no longer matches the agent app's `Antigravity` / `antigravity` process names.
  - Workspace storage scan now reads `Antigravity IDE/User/workspaceStorage` (the IDE's new per-product AppData / `Application Support` / `.config` location) instead of the legacy `Antigravity/...` path that now belongs to the agent app.
  - External script editor entries are always labelled `Antigravity IDE` — the ambiguous bare `Antigravity` display name was removed.

### Changed

- Insider builds (`Antigravity IDE - Insider.exe`, `antigravity-ide-insiders`, `Antigravity IDE - Insider*.app`) are now recognised on all three platforms.
- Package display name updated to **Antigravity IDE Editor**; package description refreshed to mention the Antigravity 2.0 split explicitly.
- Documentation (`README.md`, `Documentation~/index.md`, `Documentation~/using-visual-studio-editor.md`) updated to reflect the IDE rename, new install paths, and product-name detection.

> **Note:** v1.0.6 originally shipped with a PolyForm Noncommercial dual-license. This was rolled back in v1.0.7 — the entire package is MIT-licensed again. Treat the dual-license note from v1.0.6 release notes as withdrawn.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- Removed orphaned `Editor/Plugins.meta` so Unity no longer warns about a missing `Packages/com.unity.ide.antigravity/Editor/Plugins` folder during import

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Removed `AppleEventIntegration.bundle` from this package to avoid duplicate editor plugin-name conflicts when `com.boxqkrtm.ide.cursor` is installed

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Disabled `AppleEventIntegration.bundle` for this package to avoid duplicate editor plugin-name conflicts when `com.boxqkrtm.ide.cursor` is installed

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Regenerated all package `.meta` GUIDs to prevent GUID conflicts with `com.boxqkrtm.ide.cursor` when both packages are installed in the same project

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Workspace config files (`launch.json`, `settings.json`, `extensions.json`) now written to `.vscode/` — Antigravity reads these as a VS Code fork
- Extensions are looked up from `~/.antigravity/extensions/` (Antigravity's native extension directory)
- Fixed uninitialized `antigravityStoragePath` variable on unsupported platforms (added `#else` early return)
- Removed no-op `IOPath.Combine` wrappers on `GetFolderPath` calls (macOS and Windows)
- Removed orphaned `.meta` files for deleted Cursor and Codium installation classes

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Initial release: Google Antigravity integration for Unity as an external code editor
- Auto-discovery of Antigravity installations on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Generates `.sln` and `.csproj` files for IntelliSense support
- "Reuse existing Antigravity window" preference toggle
- Workspace detection via Antigravity's `workspaceStorage` directory
